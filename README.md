# Cryptocurrency Data Mining Project

## Introduction
In this data mining project, the objective is to analyze the historical price trends of major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB. The project aims to gain insights into the price movements and patterns of these cryptocurrencies.

## Data Collection
Data was collected using the CoinGecko API, which provides comprehensive data on cryptocurrency prices and market trends. Historical price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB was gathered for analysis.

## Data Understanding and Preparation
An initial analysis was conducted to comprehend the dataset. This involved describing the data frame, calculating descriptive statistics for each cryptocurrency, and identifying unique values within each column. Data cleaning was performed to address incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent data, as well as transcription errors and outdated information. Data transformation included converting date columns to proper date formats and performing feature engineering to enhance analysis.

## Modeling
After understanding and preparing the data, clustering algorithms were applied to identify patterns within the dataset. K-means, DBSCAN, and OPTICS clustering algorithms were utilized. The dataset was then divided into training and test sets for predictive modeling. Decision tree and random forest algorithms were employed to develop predictive models based on dataset features.

## Interpretation and Evaluation
Results obtained from clustering and predictive modeling were analyzed. Conclusions were drawn based on the analysis findings, providing insights into the overall trends and similarities within the cryptocurrency market.
